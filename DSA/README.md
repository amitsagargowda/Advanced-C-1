**Data Structure & ALgorithm**

		The data structure name indicates itself that organizing the data in memory. There are many ways of organizing the data 
		in the memory as wehave already seen one of the data structures, i.e., array in C language. 
		Array is a collection of memory elements in which data is stored sequentially, i.e., one after another. In other words, 
		we can say that array stores the elements in a continuous manner. This organization of data is done with the help of an 
		array of data structures. There are also other ways to organize the data in memory.

		Data Structure such as Array, Pointer, Structure, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Graph, Searching, Sorting, Programs, etc.

**Types of Data Structure**

		There are two types of data structures:

		1. Linear Data Structure
		2. Non-linear Data Structure

		Linear data structures: Elements of Linear data structure are accessed in a sequential manner, however the elements can
					be stored in these data structure in any order. 
					Examples of linear data structure are: LinkedList, Stack, Queue and Array

		Non-linear data structures: Elements of non-linear data structures are stores and accessed in non-linear order. 
					    Examples of non-linear data structure are: Tree and Graph


**Data Structure Asymptotic Notation**

		Asymptotic Notation are the expressions that are used to represent the complexity of a program.

		Best case    : In which we analyse the performance of an algorithm for the input, for which the algorithm takes less
			       time or space.

		Worst case   : In which we analyse the performance of an algorithm for the input, for which the algorithm takes long  
                               time or space.

		Average case : In which we analyse the performance of an algorithm for the input, for which the algorithm takes less 
			       time or space.

		[Note : Always use the worst case for solving problems]


**Types of DS Asymptotic Notation**

		1. Big-O Notation (Ο) – Big O notation specifically describes worst case scenario.
		2. Omega Notation (Ω) – Omega(Ω) notation specifically describes best case scenario.
		3. Theta Notation (θ) – This notation represents the average complexity of an algorithm.
