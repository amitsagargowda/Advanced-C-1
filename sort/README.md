**bubble_sort.c**

		It is a simple algorithm which is used to sort a given set of n elements provided in form of an 
		array with 'n' no. of elements. It compares all the elements one by one and sort them based on their 
		values.
		In bubble sort, if there are 'n' no. of elements are there, then there will be 'n-1' iterations. And 
		for every sorting operations there will be adjacent elements will be compared in a proper way.

					4    5    1    2    3	=> elements
	                              ------------------------
			               [0]  [1]  [2]  [3]  [4]	=> array

		1st iteration : 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4
		2nd iteration : 0-1, 1-2, 2-3
		3rd iteration : 0-1, 1-2
		4th iteration : 0-1
